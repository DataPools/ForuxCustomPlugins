# Forux Custom Plugins
This is a collection of plugins commissioned for the Minecraft server ForuxPVP. These plugins were made by two developers, Exloki and Richard B.

The little (mostly incomplete) documentation I was able to scrape from Skype conversations is available in the docs/ folder. The documentation notes are primarily four year old commission specifications that provide a broad overview of what I wanted. 

The compiled jar files are available in the jars/ folder.

Most of the source code is available in the sources/ folder.

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to open an issue.

If you'd like to add the documentation, feel free to make a PR.
