ForuxTeams
Teams plugin
This plugin is meant for a survival server. This is meant to allow players team up together. Teams cannot have more than 4 players (However they can have less). People in teams cannot damage their team mates. Team mates can also teleport to each other. Teams have a special "team chat" that is only shown to members of their team. There is also multi-world support. In the config, the teleport function can be disabled in certain worlds and team friendly fire can be allowed in certain worlds.
 
Commands:
/team create - Create a team. Person who creates team is the only one who can invite people
/team invite <player> - Used to invite other players to their team.
/team teleport <player> - Used to teleport to other team mates. Players cannot teleport to others not in their team.
/team leave - Allows the player to leave the team. If team leader leaves, the entire team is disbanded and all players in that team are kicked from the team.
