Name: LoreTransfer
I need this plugin to basically allow books with custom enchants from the plugin EnchantsPlus to be able to be used like normal enchant books.
 
Books with the special custom enchant lores will carry over into the final item product. To sum it up: Books with special custom enchant lore from EnchantsPlus behave exactly as normal enchant books would in an anvil.

Example:
I combine a diamond sword and a custom enchant book with JUST the lore: "Hi!", the final product comes out with a diamond sword with the lore "Hi!"
