Name: EcoRewards
Features:
- Hook onto Vault
Basically, what it does is that when a players' balance goes over a specified amount(s) in the config. When their balance meets this amount, a configurable message is given to the player & certain permissions are added to them. When their balance goes beneath specified amount they get another (different) configurable message and the permissions that were added are taken away. Multiple amounts can be specified.
- The /ecorewards command, which will open a GUI stating the different levels of balance, configurable items and lores for each balance level.
Example:
My balance reaches $10,000 a message is given saying I have reached $10,000 and gained a kit permission. My balance goes underneath $10,000 a message is given to me that my balance is under $10,000 and I have lost my kit permission. Say I reach $10,000 (I get the kit) and then get $100,000, a message is given to me that I reached $100,000 and I have a special warp.
